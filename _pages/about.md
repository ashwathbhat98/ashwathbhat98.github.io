I'm a Software Engineer at PayPal Inc., reporting to [Minesh Desai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mineshdesai/), where I am involved in building the next-generation payments ecosystem.

I hold a master's degree from Arizona State University, Tempe, where I worked with the [TOMNET Lab](https://tomnet-utc.engineering.asu.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Ram M. Pendyala](https://search.asu.edu/profile/980477) and the mentorship of [Dr. Irfan Batur](https://search.asu.edu/profile/3243599). My research was focused on uncovering trends and patterns in the Time Use, Travel, and Telework behaviors across various sociodemographic attributes in the United States. I built an open-source platform, [T3 Dashboard](https://tomnetutc.github.io/t3d/), offering instant insights using the ATUS data.

Before my master's, I worked for two years as a Software Engineer with Citi India, Citigroup. During the first year, I was building the Citi Velocity - Research platform and transforming the legacy services into microservices. In my second year, I was part of the TTS organization, managing the payments middleware (payment validation and optimization) for its clients in the CEE/MENA regions. I was recognized with the Citi Gratitude Gold Award for outstanding contributions to project success by senior management.

I am also generally interested in building scalable microservices and cloud-native applications. Lately, I've been delving deep into the world of distributed systems.
